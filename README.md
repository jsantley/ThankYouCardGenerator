# ThankYouCardGenerator

This Thank You card generator was a project that I thought of while attempting to help my wife write our large amoung of thank you cards following our wedding.  
This is a simple program that I was able to throw together in a matter of an hour to showcase my understanding and ability to create a Windows Form application with C#. 
I have been taught and learned mostly on scripting languages like Python and Ruby and haven't really learned a lot of OOP concepts fully. My goal is to rectify that with the study of
C#.  My hope is to continue editing this program to get rid of the bugs that exist in it.
